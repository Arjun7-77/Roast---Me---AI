### Project Description
Roast Me AI is a lighthearted and humorous web application that uses AI to generate witty, sarcastic, and slightly savage ‚Äúroasts‚Äù based on user input. Users can upload their picture or write something about themselves, and the AI will respond with a playful roast in seconds. The aim is pure entertainment ‚Äì no real harm intended, just laughs.

### The Problem (that doesn‚Äôt exist)
People are becoming too nice on the internet. Compliments are everywhere, but no one‚Äôs giving out the good old sarcastic burns that build character. Life without friendly roasting is‚Ä¶ boring.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built an AI-powered roast generator that can roast your face or your bio instantly. Just upload your picture or write about yourself, and the AI will hit you with a roast so clever that even your mirror might file a complaint.

### Technical Details
Technologies/Components Used

Languages: JavaScript, HTML, CSS

Frameworks: Next.js (or React) for frontend, Flask/FastAPI for backend

Libraries:

OpenAI API / Hugging Face for AI roast generation

Multer (Node.js) for image upload handling

Tailwind CSS for styling

Tools:

Vercel for deployment

GitHub for version control

For Hardware:
(Not needed, it‚Äôs a web app ‚Äì but for fun‚Ä¶)

Laptop/PC (minimum 4GB RAM, i3 processor or above)

Internet connection strong enough to handle savage burns
